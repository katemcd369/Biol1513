RESEARCH EXPERIENCE    

1.	Sexual Dimorphism study on color patterns of Marbled Salamanders  
2.	Studied the effects of Chemical Cues in fleeing Behaviors in salamander larvae  
3.	Studies the effects of kairomones on the growth rates of larval salamanders  
4.	Assisted in an eDNA survey of Hellbenders in Northern Alabama  
5.	Assisted in an eDNA survey of Blue Shiners in North Eastern Alabama  
6.	Assisted in Invasive research on Apple Snails in Mobile Alabama identifying parasites  
7.	Designed novel primer for *Necturus spp.*  
8.	Performed eDNA survey of *Necturus spp.* in North Eastern Alabama  

PUBLICATIONS  
**Manuscript in Review (submitted June 2019)**: *Ambystoma maculatum* (Spotted Salamander) Polyembryony.  
**Manuscript in Review (submitted January 2020)**: An eDNA Approach to *Surveying Necturus spp.* in Central and Northern Alabama Waterways.  

PRESENTATIONS  

1.	Sexual Dimorphism in the Marbled Salamander (*Ambystoma opacum*): (2014) There is an observed color differential between male and female Marbled salamanders. This presentation went over my research on the topic and the statistics showing that there is truly a significant difference in the color pattern of males and females.  
2.	Mander Madness: (2018) Presentation for the annual Herp Fest at the Anniston Museum of Natural History. A quick overview of the salamanders that can be found in Alabama and some fun facts about them.  
3.	An eDNA Approach to Surveying *Necturus spp.* in Northern and Eastern Alabama Waterways: (ASB 2019, ALPARC 2019) New range map data for *Necturus spp.* was presented along with a newly formed primer that was able to detect all *Necturus spp.* in Alabama.  

POSTERS AND ABSTRACTS

1.	Differential Fleeing Behavior in Spotted Salamander Larvae (*Ambystoma maculatum*) in Response to Predator Chemical Cues: Poster presented at Southeastern Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation conference described the methodology behind testing the fleeing behavior of larval salamanders by using the chemical cues of different predators, proposing that the prey would react differently based on predator type and threat.  
2.	Differential Growth Curves of Larval Salamanders in Vernal Pools from Calhoun County Alabama: This poster presented at the Jacksonville State University Student Symposium described the methodology and preliminary data from a joint lab and field experiment measuring growth rates of two species of larval salamanders (*Ambystoma maculatum* and *Ambystoma opacum*). It was proposed that from observations *A. maculatum* would have a higher growth rate in the presence of predator (*A. opacum*) kairomones, and that *A. opacum* would have a higher growth rate in the presence of prey (*A. maculatum*) kairomones. It was also proposed that *A. maculatum* would have a higher growth rate overall.  

WORKSHOPS ATTENDED  

1.	AR Cure 2018: Learned to design and teach using the CURE method for Genetics labs  

SYNERGISTIC ACTIVITIES  

1.	Teaching and Student Mentoring:  I teach a variety of Undergraduate biology labs and courses. I have taught the course Introduction to Biology I. Labs Taught include: Genetics CURE, Introduction to Biology I and II, Honors Introduction to Biology I and II, Human Anatomy and Physiology I and II at JSU. While attending Auburn University, I was the Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for Herpetology and tutored students in a variety of courses: Herpetology, Introduction to Biology, Organismal Biology, Genetics, Ecology, Invertebrate Biodiversity, Vertebrate Biodiversity, and Mammalogy.  

2.	Outreach:  I have assisted in and organized talks and other outreach programs for both JSU and Auburn University, including programs with the Little River Canyon Field school. These programs include teaching students from elementary to high school about animals and conservation, participating in Frog Pond Talks with Dr. George Cline, and participating in programs such as Herp Fest and the Little River Canyon BioBlitz.  

3.	Professional Service:  I was a member of a two-man team to revise the Graduate Assistant contracts for Jacksonville State university which doubled the pay received per month for each Graduate Teaching Assistant. I was also a part of the hiring committee to selects the new Dean for the School of Science at Jacksonville State University.  

4.	Skills Obtained:  I have worked with multiple computer programs for data collection and analysis including R, GIS, Raven. ImageJ, MorphoJ, Photoshop, Minitab, and Microsoft Office. I have spent extensive time doing field work which required hiking, camping, kayaking, using different trapping methods, eDNA, and backpack electroshocking. I am experienced in Field identification of mammals, birds, fish and herps of Alabama. I am experienced in doing field prep for mammals and herps. I am experienced in animal husbandry for mammals, birds, and herps.  

GRANTS AND FUNDING  
1.	U. S. Forest Service Grant: ~$3,000
